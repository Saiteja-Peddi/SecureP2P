# SecureP2P

The popularity of file systems continues to grow. Fault tolerance, availability, scalability, and performance make them preferable to conventional centralized file systems. We are using the python programming language to create a secure and encrypted zfile system. For redundancy of the files and directories that are saved, we use a main file server and two replica servers. This file system enables us to share files with multiple users while ensuring that all operations are secure and performed by authorized users.


As like all file systems, our system too has a basic set of Input Output functionalities. Files can be created, deleted, read, written, and restored by authorized users. Concurrent users can also perform operations on the DFS while the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties are maintained.The use of RSA to encrypt and decrypt data between users is being discussed as a means of ensuring security and secrecy to avoid unauthorized users from accessing data.
